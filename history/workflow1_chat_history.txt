List all message format(s) on the protocol based on the upload file and your knowledge. If there only exists one format, just named as protocolName format. You should respond as follows:
```json
    {{"protocol_name":"{protocolName}","message_formats":[{{"format_name":"name of the format"}}]}}
```

Please evaluate our previously discussed message formats for compliance with the latest protocol standards. Identify any formats that are outdated and exclude them. Then, provide the updated JSON for the merged format(s).
